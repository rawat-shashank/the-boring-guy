### Problem Statement

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

### Concept

This question asks to figure out if the array contains a duplicate element. We need to make sure if all elements are distinct or not.

To make sure all elements are distinct, we will need to iterate them once, and while iterating we will save each element in a dictionary. Since key search is O(1) in dictionary, it will make our algorithm to find if any element is duplicated or not

Iteration

```python
    for x in nums
```

Search

```python
    if x in data
```

If the data is not there in the dictionary, we can add the element into the dictionary. And if the iteration is over without any match, then we have a unique or distinct array.

### Complexity

Time : **O(n)** - As mentioned earlier we will iterate is once in the worst case, which is array is unique or distinct.

Space: **O(n)** - In the worst case we will be storying all the elements as key.

### Code

```python

def containsDuplicate(self, nums) -> bool:
    data = {}
    for x in nums:
        if x in data:
            return True
        else:
            data[x] = x
    return False

```
