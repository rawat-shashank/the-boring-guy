### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

### Concept

This question is a great example a HashMap or key value pairs. The key to solve this question is to understand, this requires the first matching pair, as it require only one solution.
While we start looping through the given array, we check if the element is stored in dict (HashMap, object) here. If not, we will save the (sum – current element value) as index and index as value, since we need to return the index of both the element.
Let’s take an example,
nums=[2, 7, 11, 15]
target=9

for the first element  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;el=2, index =0, dict = {}  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;check if 2 in dict exists:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if not, we will save dict[target-el] = index ==> dict{7: 0}

let’s read the next element 7,  
el=2, index =1, dict = {7: 0}  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;check if dict of 7 exists:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yes, we can return the current index, and value of dict[7] which is in fact index of 2 which is at position 0 as we seen in previous step.
Let’s convert this into code.

### Code

```python

def twoSum(self, nums, target: int):
    outDict = {}
    for idx, val in enumerate(nums):
        if val in outDict:
            return [outDict[val], idx]
        else:
            outDict[target - val] = idx
    return []

```
